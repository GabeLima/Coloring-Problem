Imports-
sys - Used to take args from the command line
time - Used to get the timing of the program

I used Python 3.7, just run from the command line like the document suggests.
It prints some output for debugging/report purposes, but the main answer
is written to the output file. Make sure that the supporting file (constraints.py)
is properly imported, otherwise dfsb.py and minconflicts.py wont parse the 
input correctly.
